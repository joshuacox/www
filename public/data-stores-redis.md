## Redis on octohost

Adding a Redis data store to an octohost website.

*TLDR: 3 git pushes - three linked single use containers.*

To make this happen, we will utilize 3 containers in total:

1. Data only container to store the Redis dump.rdb file.
2. Redis application container that uses the volume from #1 to persist the data between container upgrades.
3. The web application container that is linked to the Redis application container.

We use a simple naming convention to make the linking and volume sharing easier:

1. appname\_datastore\_data - for the data storage container.
2. appname\_datastore - for the storage daemon.
3. appname - for the actual web application that links to the storage daemon.

This way - we always know what container name we're looking for when we're linking them up.

First, let's create the [data](http://www.tech-d.net/2013/12/16/persistent-volumes-with-docker-container-as-volume-pattern/) [only](http://www.offermann.us/2013/12/tiny-docker-pieces-loosely-joined.html) container.

Here's the Dockerfile:

```
FROM          busybox
VOLUME        ["/var/lib/redis"]
CMD           ["true"]
# NO_HTTP_PROXY
# ADD_NAME
```

The last two lines are important, they tell the [receiver script](https://github.com/octohost/octohost/blob/master/bin/receiver.sh) on octohost to:

1. Do not add an entry into the HTTP proxy - this won't be accessed from outside the machine.
2. Add a name [so that we can share the volume](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/working_with_volumes/)

When that's pushed - you should see this:

```

remote: Successfully built dcb61d3a1cf7
To git@server.octohost.io:testing_redis_data.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

The data container is complete  - let's add the Redis application container:

```
FROM octohost/redis
EXPOSE 6379
# NO_HTTP_PROXY
# ADD_NAME
# VOLUMES_FROM
CMD ["/usr/bin/redis-server"]
```

Like the data container, there are a few important commented items at the end of the Dockerfile:

1. Do not add an entry into the HTTP proxy - this won't be accessed from outside the machine.
2. Add a name [so that we can link to this container](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/working_with_volumes/)
3. Use the data only container we already created as the data storage location.

Here's what happens on the push:

```

remote: Port: 49240
To git@server.octohost.io:testing_redis.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master

 ```
 
We've provisioned a Redis server and it's ready to go.

Now let's link up the final application container - here's the Dockerfile:
 
 ```
 FROM octohost/ruby-1.9
 ADD . /srv/www
 RUN cd /srv/www; bundle install --deployment --without test development
 # LINK_SERVICE redis
 EXPOSE 5000
 CMD ["/usr/local/bin/foreman","start","-d","/srv/www"]
 ```
 
There's only 1 special comment in this Dockerfile - on push, octohost links this container to the Redis container we created in step 2. Let's try it:
 
 ```
 [master] darron@/app: git push octo master

And here's the live site - with a Redis INCR counter: [http://testing.octohost.io/](http://testing.octohost.io/)

3 pushes - 3 containers:

1. [Data only container.](https://github.com/octohost/redis_data)
2. [Redis container running and using #1 for data storage.](https://github.com/octohost/redis_container)
3. [Small Sinatra app linked to the Redis container.](https://github.com/octohost/redis_app)

Take a look at the Sinatra code here: [https://github.com/octohost/redis_app](https://github.com/octohost/redis_app)
