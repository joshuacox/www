## PORTS on octohost

### This is another "magic" Dockerfile comment.

Adding non-http/https assigned ports to an octohost container automagically.
The magic comment PORTS\_FROM\_HOST will assign ports from the host to the container.

e.g. to forward all traffic from port 8080 to the container add this line to your Dockerfile:

`# PORTS_FROM_HOST 8080 8080`

i.e.

`# PORTS_FROM_HOST X Y`

corresponds to a command line option of:

`-p 0.0.0.0:X:Y`

NOTE: you can add multiple of these lines to add multiple ports to a container

CAVEATS: In docker the -P and -p flags appear to be mutually exclusive,
i.e. they donâ€™t play well together, 
as such using this option removes the -P flag
and I am using with the NO_HTTP_PROXY magic comment as well.
YMMV
